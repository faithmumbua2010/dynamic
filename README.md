# Assignment 2: Dynamic Time-Based Web Page

## Project Description

This project is a dynamic HTML web page designed to provide real-time information and adapt its appearance based on the time of day and user preference. It features a live-updating clock, automatic background color changes corresponding to morning, afternoon, or night, and a manual toggle for light and dark mode themes. All functionality is implemented using embedded JavaScript and CSS within a single HTML file.

## Features

* **Live Digital Clock:** Displays the current time (Hours:Minutes:Seconds) accurately and updates every second without requiring a page refresh.
* **Time-of-Day Background:** The background color of the page automatically changes based on the current hour:
* **Light/Dark Mode Toggle:** Includes a user-clickable button or switch to manually change the page's theme between a predefined light mode and dark mode. This allows user preference to override the time-based default.
* **Embedded Code:** All necessary CSS and JavaScript code is embedded directly within the HTML file for simplicity and portability.

## Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3 (Embedded)
* JavaScript (ES6+) (Embedded)

## How to Use

1.  **Download:** Obtain the single HTML file for this project.
2.  **Open:** Open the HTML file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.).
3.  **Observe:**
    * Watch the digital clock update every second.
    * Note the page's background color â€“ it should correspond to the current time of day (morning, afternoon, or night) based on the rules set in the code.
    * Locate the Light/Dark mode toggle button/switch on the page.
4.  **Interact:** Click the toggle button to switch between the light and dark themes manually.

## File Structure

As all code is embedded, the project consists of a single file, dynamic.html
